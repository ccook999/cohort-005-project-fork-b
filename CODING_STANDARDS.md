## Fail with a thrown response, not a return value

A loader or an action that cannot continue throws. It does not return an
error shape for the component to unpack.

```ts
if (!course) throw data("Course not found", { status: 404 });
```

The route then has one success path. A returned error shape gives every
component a second path to forget about.

## Parse untrusted input with a schema

Form data, search parameters and request bodies get a zod schema before the
values reach any query. Do not read `formData.get("x") as string`. The cast
is a lie the type checker believes.

## Do not write `any`, and do not write `!`

Both switch the type checker off at the exact point you are least sure. If a
value can be missing, narrow it with a check. If you cannot name the type,
the shape is wrong — fix the shape.

## Store money as integer cents

Every amount of money is a whole number of cents in an `integer` column, and
only `formatPrice(cents)` turns it into dollars for the screen. Work discounts
out in cents and round once, with `Math.round`, at the point of sale. A
floating-point dollar amount drifts under arithmetic, and SQLite has no
decimal type to fall back on.
